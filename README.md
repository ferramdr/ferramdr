# Fernando Ramírez
_Software Engineering Student | Aspiring Data Analyst & Future Data Scientist_

I’m a Software Engineering student and a hybrid professional: I combine a solid software engineering foundation (Clean Code, Data Structures & Algorithms, systems thinking) with a growing focus on data analysis and machine learning. I don’t just analyze data — I build the systems, dashboards, and applications that put data to work.

## Featured Projects

- **FinReport AI**  
  A financial dashboard concept focused on clean, actionable data visualization and UX. I led the UI/UX design in Figma and implemented interactive visualizations to communicate KPIs and trends clearly.  
  - Technologies: Figma (design), React (frontend concept), Python (data pipeline prototype)  
  - Highlights: Designed responsive dashboards with an emphasis on data clarity and decision-making flows.

- **Task Key**  
  A parental control application that enforces routines through task-based access control. Emphasis on product logic, user flows, and a clear pitch describing the problem → solution → value.  
  - Technologies: Node.js (backend logic), React (frontend prototype), PostgreSQL (data storage)  
  - Highlights: Built product wireframes, defined permission logic, and prepared a concise pitch deck to communicate value to parents.

- **Personal Portfolio**  
  My personal web portal showcasing projects, case studies, and a technical blog. Built with a modern React frontend and Node.js backend to demonstrate full-stack capabilities.  
  - Technologies: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, deployed to a cloud platform  
  - Highlights: Showcases live demos, source code links, and write-ups focused on engineering trade-offs and data-focused projects.

- **ANIEI Data Analysis Course**  
  A hands-on data analysis course where I completed multiple real-world assignments and case studies emphasizing EDA, data cleaning, and visualization.  
  - Technologies: Python (pandas, matplotlib/seaborn), SQL, Jupyter Notebooks  
  - Highlights: Completed EDA projects, produced reproducible notebooks, and built dashboards to present insights across datasets.

- **RazoConnect**  
  A collaboration/communication project (RazoConnect) where I contributed to the entire development of the project, a full stack development tha challenged my skills and also made me leaarn a lot about database design and web development
  - Technologies: Node.js, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, React, HTML, CSS 
  - Highlights: Implemented endpoints for message delivery tracking, built metrics pipelines for basic user analytics, and collaborated on product requirements.

## Current Focus

- Deepening practical skills in Data Analysis (exploratory data analysis, cleaning, visualization) and Machine Learning fundamentals while finishing my Software Engineering degree.
- Working on end-to-end projects that combine data pipelines, model prototypes, and production-ready frontends/dashboards.
- Hobby: High-Performance Computing & Hardware — I enjoy building custom PCs and exploring performance tuning, which informs my interest in efficient, scalable data systems.

## How I Work

- Engineer-first mindset: I apply engineering discipline (clean code, testing, algorithmic thinking) to data problems.
- Product-aware: I design data experiences with user value and product goals in mind.
- Lifelong learner: autodidact with a focus on practical, portfolio-driven learning.
- I like to use AI to develop faster and better.
